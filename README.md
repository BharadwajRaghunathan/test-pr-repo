PR Agent Test Repository
This repository is designed to serve as the primary testbed for validating the PR Agent automated code review system. It contains sample Python files and Pull Requests intended to simulate real-world code changes and demonstrate the functionality of the automated review pipeline.

Purpose
This test repository enables:

Testing the PR Agent with controlled inputs.

Evaluating the quality and accuracy of static analysis.

Demonstrating bug and style detection using sample "bad" and "good" Python code.

Integrating with GitHub Actions or other CI pipelines for fully automated code review.

Simulating Pull Requests that trigger the review automation.

bad_code.py: Contains Python code with multiple intentional issues (syntax, style, unused variables, unreachable code) to test the detection capabilities.

good_code.py: Contains clean Python code with minimal issues to verify that the review system identifies mostly clean files.

.github/workflows/pr-review.yml: Defines the GitHub Actions workflow to trigger the PR Agent automated review whenever Python files are changed in a Pull Request.

README.md: This documentation file describing the repository and its role.

Using This Repository
Create Pull Requests involving changes to bad_code.py and good_code.py.

The PR Agent listens to the PR events via webhooks or CI workflows.

Automated reviews are triggered by the GitHub Actions workflow upon PR updates.

Review results, including detailed bugs, style and security issues, and recommendations, are posted back as comments on the Pull Request.

The system computes overall quality scores and flags risks to guide code improvement.

Integration with PR Agent
This repository serves as the input source for the PR Agent running in the backend server.

The PR Agent fetches changed files, analyzes them using Pylint, Flake8, AST parsing, and security scanning rules.

Results are compiled into comprehensive reports and optionally posted as GitHub comments.

Supports full automation in a CI/CD pipeline environment including GitHub Actions as well as manual API trigger calls.
